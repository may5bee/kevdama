NOTE:<br>
These were a bunch of journals that I wrote on a hitchiking trip in early 2017. I went back to edit them later on change the tense and make the form more palatable to an audience. I tried, really.<br>

i had split up with my girlfriend and was crashing at my friend Kelvin’s place, working on a website for the university and spending the rest of my time up in the Mountain View Public Library. 

So Kelvin has a dog named Luna and after he went to work I’d walk her and then come back and cook sausages and eggs. 

i’d dreamed of seeing the country for a while, always vaguely planning and never taking off. now all the necessary conditions had been met, but I was dawdling, being slow, hanging around old friends, reading books and never biting the bullet.

The Skanerman was my friend from Cornell, he lived in Austin and he said that I should come visit him. So I packed up one day and had a meal with Kelvin and told him excitedly that I was ready to take off, and then I took a bus to around a hundred meters before the entrance to Highway 1, where I stuck my thumb out, and stood feeling foolish for 10 minutes.

My first ride was with an elderly Navajo woman and her friend. She was going to church and it was at a casino. We talked for a while and as the trip became long, we got quiet and I fell asleep for a bit. She dropped me off in San Bernardino.
 
I walked around and didn't see many people. The pale stucco houses seemed to stretch on forever. Soon it was dark and I went to a corner store and bought some Pop-Tarts. the guard looked at me suspiciously the entire time. Was it my imagination? I ate the whole box and didn't feel that good. 

I had bought camping things, and had an idea of how I was going to use them. The sleeping pad went under the sleeping bag, and I'd wrap everything up in a survival Bivvy. But the question of where to camp hadn't been something I thought too much about. I got anxious as I walked through the night straining my eyes to find a place to camp. But then I figured that other people would be more scared of me than I was of them.

I walked through the university and walked, but there were lights everywhere. A guard strolled around.

It was dark when I spotted a ladder going up the side of an ...autozone. I climbed up and threw my things in a pile. I crawled into the sleeping bag, and looked up at the blue, black sky. I was exhausted and sleeping on a roof in the open in a town I had never heard of before I got into it and suddenly it seemed so stupid, so ridiculously stupid, that I was here and I wished that I would fall asleep and wake up back at kelvin's house and eat my nice breakfast and be able to go to the library.

I couldn't sleep so I went back down the ladder and got some melatonin at the 7-11. I ate six of them.

I woke up in the morning, very early. It was cold. I wrote a funny sign and it felt silly, so I wrote a new one just saying Indio, which seemed to be the next large little city. 

We picked up an old guy called Bill and a young guy called Dylan. Bill needed gas, Dylan was going to Tuscon. Dylan kept on interrupting Andrew when he was talking to go off on unnecessary tangents about THC and doing your own thing in life.
