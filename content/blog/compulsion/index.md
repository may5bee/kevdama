Innocuous statements, right? 

After all, it's how we’re trained since young. To visualize outcomes, set goals, and then take the necessary steps to achieve them. This approach works, otherwise it wouldn't be so widespread.

But it only works for mechanical processes. In the pursuit of any art - business, sports, music - this approach won't take you very far. I find that people like the idea of having goals more than engaging  the process of attaining those goals.

Let's flip these statements around:

> *I have to write about this idea.*

> *I have to draw this thing that I see in front of me.*

> *I have to create this and sell it.*

What's the difference?

The first group of statements come from the desire to be some 'type' of person. In other words, they come from a desire for attention. I want to be a type of person so I figure out to be percieved as that type of person. A recipe for feeling good maybe, but never efficacy.

The second group are driven by compulsion. Call it obsession or whatever you want. 

Socrates claimed to have a daimonion, a “divine something” that compelled him to do the right thing. The Iliad begins with the speaker of the poem invoking the Muse, asking her to sing the epic **through** him. Is it true that only some are born with the ability to be obsessed?

*With good enough genetics you get these in your head.*

I don't think so.

Treating this as a talent argument does these people a disservice. For all of their otherworldly creativity and ability, they are incredibly human. 

I think their internal dialogue just spoke louder to them than in others.

I argue that your **genes always know what they want**. 

The problem is that their voices are drowned out by what other people say you should want. 

This happens at every level of human existence. We're influenced by massive fractals of thought patterns our entire lives. Every group we consider ourselves a part of dreams a different dream. 

In finding your own voice, I think the only answer is there is no how-to. It's a messy process.

But the how not-to is clear to me. You don't get there ever, when you start with the desire for attention.

*Good actors turn the compulsion they have to act to their characters' compulsion.*

Most of modern life is built around attention-seeking. And people forget what they were paying attention to 10 minutes ago.

So explore your natural interests. Nobody in the world knows what they are.

You might not know what they are. 

If that’s the case I’m jealous of you. 

This is the best part.

Because when you know you know. It’ll hit you like a rock and your brain will explode when the neurons are suddenly all going off at the same time and you realize you’ve been starved, like a traveler in a barren desert seeing water for the very first time.
