*Remember TED Talks at all?*

Remember the most popular TED talk of all time? 

Yes, I'm talking about Power Posing.

If you haven't seen it: In 2012, HBS Professor Amy Cuddy created a sensation by talking about the bidirectional feedback-loop between mood & body language. It's definitely [worth the watch](https://www.ted.com/talks/amy_cuddy_your_body_language_may_shape_who_you_are?language=en
).


### Why this post exists

Recently, my Mom sent the talk in our family chat. I rewatched it and it was just as inspiring as the first time I saw it in college.

It got me thinking though: how applicable is power-posing?

Let's rewind through the 3 parts of the talk for some context:

- **[The Pledge:](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/91029-every-great-magic-trick-consists-of-three-parts-or-acts)** Cuddy directs our attention to the fact that humans pay a lot of attention to the body-language of others, because it tells us how they're really feeling. It's a forgone conclusion that our minds change our bodies, what if that worked the other way? What if, just what if, our bodies could change our minds?

- **The Turn:** Cuddy conducts a study. It turns out that subjects standing in high power (expansive, space-filling)  postures for 2-3 minutes score higher in testosterone and lower in cortisol, both factors associated with higher dominance, than they did at the start of the experiment. Cuddy concludes that body language does indeed change thought patterns, which change real world outcomes.

- **The Prestige:** Cuddy reveals personal motivations for her research. A debilitating car accident in college decreased her IQ by 2 standard deviations. She struggled to graduate college. Even as she evetually became a PhD candidate at Princeton, she felt like an 'impostor' who was going to be 'found out' at any moment. She tells her advisor she is going to drop out, to which the advisor tells her that she will in fact not drop out, but instead fake it until she mades it. She follows this advice, until one day she no longer feels fake: her confidence is internalized.

The story is so touching that we're willing to overlook the disconnect between the conclusion of the research and the conclusion of the talk. We're initially told to power-pose to increase our immediate brain-chemistry, and later told to "fake it 'til you make it" to increase our long-term confidence. 

It appeared to me that the reason for Cuddy's eventual success was not power-posing, but for the exact things her advisor recommended:

> *Do every talk that [she] ever gets asked to do.*

> *Do it and do it and do it, even if [she's] terrified and just paralyzed and having an out-of-body experience.*

Is a psychological hack really the key to forcing ourselves to forcing yourself to confront Armageddon-levels of fear and anxiety day after day? 

It's seems to me like when I tell you the way to draw is:
1. Practice drawing circles every day.
2. On the 1000th day, draw a masterpiece.

### The Limitations of Self-Talk

Cuddy emphasizes that the point of Power Posing is NOT you asserting your power over other people. It's you telling yourself how to think about yourself.

Yet, the examples that she uses are textbook examples of situations where it is necessary to signal confidence in the presence of other people: giving talks to one's intelligent grad school peers, and participating in MBA classes full of highly-dominant personalities.

Right before the speech you give in front of a hundred people, you can look in the mirror and tell yourself how confident you are. But true confidence is generated from the fact that you actually gave the speech: true confidence comes during, and it grows afterwards. Because then, you know that you can do the next one, and it'll be a bit better. And the one after that will be even better.

Just stop to think for a moment: *Have you tried power-posing?*

Did it work? Did it make you more confident in the long run?

Or was your increased confidence the result of...ya know, actually improving your competence at life? Like getting better at a technical skill. Like improving your communication and persuasion abilities. Like leading your peers in a group activity, whether it was a ski trip or a complex work project.

So back to the original question: if power posing isn't meant to be used in the presence of others, and isn't necessarily linked to long-term confidence outcomes, of what use it is? 

### Enter the Limbic System

About a month ago, I read Joe Navarro's [What Every Body is Saying: An Ex-FBI Agent's Guide to Speed-Reading People](https://www.amazon.com/What-Every-Body-Saying-Speed-Reading/dp/0061438294). 

I've had time to observe its ideas in real life, and I believe Navarro's ideas hold the key to a creating a more relevant body-language hack.

In his book, Navarro draws on his training and background as a former FBI agent to teach the reader how to interpret subtle and not-so-subtle nonverbal signals of others. Like Cuddy, he emphasizes that nonverbals are often much more powerful signals than an individual's verbal communications.

At the beginning of the book, he simplifies the brain into the thinking "human" brain and the limbic "mammalian" brain. The limbic brain is the one that reacts to the world reflexively, without any thought; it's the part of the brain we pay attention to when studying nonverbal behavior.

Navarro says that the responses of our limbic brain are hardwired in us because they can be traced back to our ancestral heritage. They are behaviors that helped our ancestors survive in a primitive world. We see them today as the unfiltered, instantaneous manifestations of our thoughts, feelings and intentions.

For example:
- The *freeze* response in the presence of danger was developed as a strategy to deal with more powerful predators. Many students survived the Columbine and Virginia Tech shootings by holding completely still and playing dead - despite the fact they had never been taught to.
- The *flight* response to something unpleasant. Since we live and work in much more enclosed spaces in the modern world, we've adapted it to meet our modern needs. We will turn our bodies away from people or topics we find unpleasant.
- The *fight* response as a final tactic for survival, when the other options have been exhausted. In its modern form, we see this more in arguments and less in physical altercations.

### Happy Feet

Now this is the interesting part: Navarro notices that people have very strong limbic reactions in their legs and feet, because:
1. Regions that control the feet and legs are closer to our limbic brain. 
2. People are much less likely to control their feet and leg behavior because they don't know that those areas are giving off signals.

As such, in the face of discomfort, our feet and legs still react as they did in prehistoric times Navarro calls them *The Most Honest Part of Our Body*.

When we're happy and excited, our feet engage in what Navarro calls 'gravity-defying behaviors'. They wiggle and bounce up and down.

He gives an example
> Recently I was watching a stranger talk on his cell phone. As he listened...The heel of the foot remained on the ground, but the rest of his shoe moved up, so that his toes were pointing skyward. To the average person, that behavior would have gone unnoticed or been disregarded as insignificant. But to the trained observer, that gravity-defying foot behavior can be readily decoded to mean that the man on the phone had just heard something positive. Sure enough, as I walked by I could hear him say, “Really—that’s terrific!” His feet had already silently said the same thing.

For me, all I have to do is look at the feet on the subway on the way to work, and then compare then to the feet on a Saturday afternoon.

On the other hand, when people are uncomfortable, their feets seem to be pulled down by gravity!

Cuddy says that our body language shapes how we feel. So why don't we use our feet and legs - our most powerful limbic brain indicators to change our thinking?

### Happy Feet in Real Life

Recently I was waking down a street near my home. I saw a sign for a construction company that was doing an exterior remodel of an apartment. I stopped to take a picture for my friend who was interested in something similar for his building.

A man opened the door asked my why I was taking the picture. 

"I'm interested in contacting the company that's doing this re-model."

He said that I was illegally taking pictures of other people's property.

My immediate reaction was a combination of anger and fear. I knew I wasn't doing anything wrong, but he seemed to have 100% confidence. My body language tightened up immediately. 

Then I suddenly remembered Navarro's book. More specifically, I remembered Happy Feet. Could I use my feet to modulate my body language in response to this situation? 

I started bouncing my feet up and down, as if I had just heard that I had a 50% salary increase...

...and I relaxed instantly: "Hey man, do you know the company owner? He has an interesting name huh..." I could have been talking with an old friend. It was quite silly.

When the man saw that he wasn't getting the reaction from me that he wanted - the wind left his sails. He slunk away.

![Happy Feet movie is actually good](./happyfeet.jpg)
*It was magical.*

Try this today the next time you're stressed or anxious about something, anything:

Bounce your feet up and down rapidly, as if you utterly ravenous and anticipating the food to come out at your favorite restaurant. 

I think you'll be surprised.

Try it the next time you're nervous around other people. The next time you're talking to a room full of people, or dealing with a boss, or an unpleasant adversary. Your whole body doesn't have to bounce, but it probably will want to. Just bounce your feet up and down.

There you have it folks. Happy Feet, an applicable version of Power Posing when you're with other people. And if we develop confidence by facing the situations that strike fear in us... Happy Feet makes those situations much more bearable.
