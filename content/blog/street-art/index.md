One day I was living in Boston and I decided to be a portrait artist, like the ones I used to see as a kid. I picked up some fold out seats, a drawing pad, some sunscreen, and took the train downtown. 

And so began my life as a portrait artist.

##The Money

I initially charged $10/portrait with "suggested minimum donation" messaging. This means most give me $10, but some gave me whatever they feel like above $10. I noticed some kind of pareto principle thing going on, where a nice fraction of people were giving me twenties.

If we rank customers using a distribution based the 80-20 rule (within every 80-20 there's a recursive 80-20...so 4% of your customers are as valuable as 96% of your customers and so on), we'd see something like this:

![Pareto thing charted - rank is how enthusiastic a customer is to pay me, output is how much they will pay.](./pareto.jpg)
*only a rough intuition here*

Flatten out the curve at my floor of $10, shown in <span class="text-red-500">red</span>. Hypothetically people could get their portraits drawn and not pay me anything, but experience the "emotional guilt tax". Nobody did this, so social etiquette matters. 

The people who absolutely love the experience/result can end up paying much more. My Rank 1 customer in real-life gave me a 100 dollar bill.

If we average out paying customers with the model above, I'm getting $16.50 per portrait. This is pretty close to the actual number.

##The Lifestyle (lol)

So can you live off your art? 

Short answer is I was able to cover all of my living expenses. To put this in context, I lived in Cambridge, an area above Boston metro known its [high cost of living](https://www.rentjungle.com/average-rent-in-cambridge-rent-trends/)!

Longer answer: I made an experiment of only using my income from street portraits to live, while I did have other income from other odd jobs.

This meant I was super focused on increasing my daily revenue early on. By FAR the most meaningful change I made was upping my suggested donation from $10 to $20, and using a thicker, more official looking card-stock material.

After I had made my inital optimizations my hourly revenue didn't change very much.

##The People

My drawing style wasn't popular with the tourist families. My audience skewed towards younger - lots of high schoolers and college students. A lot of people with creative, niche interests. A lot more locals. Otherwise, fairly even split of gender and race.

I had lots of people who said they liked to draw too and wished they kept at it.

I met some other street performers. They tend to be hyper-focused on time/place, and some are very competitive over the best locations.

##Why did you do it?

I liked talking to people about their lives. 

I didn't actually like doing the actual portraits. 

It's mentally taxing to go for accuracy with a time constraint. 

I guess I wanted to see what it was like.

##Learn anything?

If nothing else, I wanted to experimented a lot more. Gigantic banners, drawing to music, fun stuff like that.

Thursday is the best day for street performers. People are relaxing but also not fired up to GO OUT. Sunday is probably second.

I realized I would criticize myself when I went for long stretches without getting customers. I told myself that it was okay to take a break, buy some water, sit down, not draw. I found that chatting with strangers without the intent of drawing them always boosted my mood.

*LEFT: You'll see how under-marketed I was.*

It's empowering to realize that you can make money completely independently, and with a creative skill nonetheless. So yes, hone your craft, but more importantly, work on MARKETING, because that'll account for the majority of your results.

Next time I write about this, it'll be happening in Washington Square Park.
