*As a matter of experience, you are not identical to anything you notice, by the mirror fact you are noticing it.*

Thanks Sam Harris. We'll get back to you in a bit.

I was telling my friend to start a blog for a while. He has a unique voice, is good at writing, and could benefit from a creative outlet.

He finally relented. I helped him snag the domain and set up Wordpress. Since the blog is hosted on my server, I got him a theme.

Later on, I helped him come up with ideas and outlines for articles. I found all of this very enjoyable.

Then I wondered:

*Why is it so easy to help my friend on his blog and so much more difficult to work on mine?*

Ego-attachment. 

If something belongs to someone else, your ego is divorced from the project. You focus fully on the task without the outcome affecting your perception of yourself in any way.

If my ego is bound up writing the best essay ever, I become precious about the words I use about the ideas I talk about. Because me being embarrased about a blog post is a hundred times worse then my friend being embarrased about his.

So here's a thought experiement: 

I'm no longer "me". I'm a parasitic alien like one of the [Yeerks](https://animorphs.fandom.com/wiki/Yeerk) from Animorphs. I have traveled hundreds of light-years to Earth, and found a suitable human host, who I now control. For some mysterious reason, I have maintained the host's original desires. I don't however, consider myself to be the same as the host. I'm merely a controller.


This is exactly the purpose of a lot of breathing-centered meditation.
