description: "Canary is one of those cameras that give you a notification if a masked stranger is snooping around your house, or if your dog is doing something funny. 
<br><br>
Highlights include redesigning every touchpoint as the business shifted from a hardware-sales-only to SaaS-only model (you got it, that's giving away the cameras for free).
<br><br>
<b>+</b> redesigning the entire e-commerce experience for massive conversion increases (kidding, it was only around 5%...but hey, when you're pulling tens of millions in recurring revenue a year...)"
