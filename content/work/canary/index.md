I joined Canary as a Product Designer in July 2018, and took on a Lead Product Design role mid-2019. 

During this time, the business transitioned from a one-time hardware sales model to a SaaS model. Other IoT security companies, like Google's Nest and Ring were made similar strides.

The overarching challenge of the Product, Design and Engineering teams was to alter the trajectory of a company that had been built on the strengths of its products - aesthetics and hardware capabilities, towards that of a service company.

In other words: instead of offering services to sell hardware, we'd be offering hardware to sell services.

### App as Ecosystem 
![Canary App Trials](./cover.jpg)

In 2018, we recognized that our app was not only a hindrance to users trying to understand the way the Canary system worked, but also an impediment for us trying to promote Premium - our bundle of software subscription features.

Our objective in redesigning the app was to address the first-order consequences of , but the second and third order consequences that sprang from that 


### Trials

Riding the success of the app redesign, we looked into the trial experience.

PM Maciej Szelazek and I examined the most popular features as well as the features with the most percieved value, giving each a weighted score.

We tackled them one-by-one, building previews for each feature (visibility in accordance with priority) that aroused user curiosity and positioned Canary Premium as a way to avoid missing out.

### Apple's Ultimatum

In 2018, Apple told us unless we took sign-ups out of the app, it would be taken out of the store.

The problem: a trial opt-in (and web payments) to Canary Premium were offered as part of the sign-up process. Even if we took the subscriptions out, it wouldn’t matter: sign-ups had to disappear. (yes, these things can be very arbitrary)

Earlier in the year the same thing happened to Netflix and Spotify, which were prohibited from letting you sign up in-app and mentioning paid features in the app respectively.

Both companies found creative solutions. 

How could we invert a sub-optimal situation to an outcome that would be beneficial to our users and our business in the long run? To answer the question, our team took a deep dive into user data.
