description: "As Lead Product Designer at NYC startup Canary, I worked on initiatives across product and marketing. The most impactful of these was a complete redesign of the mobile and web apps as the business transitioned from a one-time-sales to a SaaS model."
intro: "When I first talked with Jon Troutman, Co-founder of Canary in 2018, I was immediately intrigued by the predicament the IoT startup was in. The company’s design-led hardware and software had built up a devoted following of early-adopters, but the business was staggering under the weight of its rapidly-growing server costs.

To thrive, the company needed to rethink its business model from the ground up. I was brought on by Jon as Lead Product Designer to drive product and growth intiatives as Canary transitioned into a service-led company and leader in the IoT home security space."

I joined Canary as a Product Designer in July 2018, and took on a Lead Product Design role mid-2019. 

During this time, the business transitioned from a one-time hardware sales model to a SaaS model. Other IoT security companies, like Google's Nest and Ring were made similar strides.

The overarching challenge of the Product, Design and Engineering teams was to alter the trajectory of a company that had been built on the strengths of its products - aesthetics and hardware capabilities, towards that of a service company.

In other words: instead of offering services to sell hardware, we'd be offering hardware to sell services.

### App as Ecosystem 
![Canary App Trials](./cover.jpg)

In 2018, we recognized that our app was not only a hindrance to users trying to understand the way the Canary system worked, but also an impediment for us trying to promote Premium - our bundle of software subscription features.

Our objective in redesigning the app was to address the first-order consequences of , but the second and third order consequences that sprang from that 


### Trials

Riding the success of the app redesign, we looked into the trial experience.

PM Maciej Szelazek and I examined the most popular features as well as the features with the most percieved value, giving each a weighted score.

We tackled them one-by-one, building previews for each feature (visibility in accordance with priority) that aroused user curiosity and positioned Canary Premium as a way to avoid missing out.

### Apple's Ultimatum

In 2018, Apple told us unless we took sign-ups out of the app, it would be taken out of the store.

The problem: a trial opt-in (and web payments) to Canary Premium were offered as part of the sign-up process. Even if we took the subscriptions out, it wouldn’t matter: sign-ups had to disappear. (yes, these things can be very arbitrary)

Earlier in the year the same thing happened to Netflix and Spotify, which were prohibited from letting you sign up in-app and mentioning paid features in the app respectively.

Both companies found creative solutions. 

How could we invert a sub-optimal situation to an outcome that would be beneficial to our users and our business in the long run? To answer the question, our team took a deep dive into user data.
