Flightdrop is your radar for incredibly discounted flights, guaranteed to be 50-70% off regular price. I consulted for the Ember Labs team to prototype, design and deliver engagement-driving experiences like the Chat UI and tiered rewards. As of 2018, the app has over 100K downloads and an average App Store rating of 4.7.

Download Flightdrop [on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/flightdrop-huge-flight-deals/id1325279425).
